# Contributing to cookiecutter+

First off, thank you for considering contributing to cookiecutter+. You're very good looking and smell nice.

## Code of Conduct

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!

Then don't.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

To be honest it's probably best to fork the codebase and fix it yourself. We'd like to help out but our schedules are pretty tight. If you do find a bug and fix it, please submit a pull request. We'll do our best to review it in a timely manner.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

You don't. Didn't we just go over this? Fork and / or fix then open a PR.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Again, fork and / or fix then open a PR.

### Local Development

cookiecutter+ can be developed locally. For instructions on how to set up and run your project locally, please refer to the [Development docs](DEVELOPMENT.md).
